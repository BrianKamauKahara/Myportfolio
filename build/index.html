                I live and have grown up in Kahawa Sukari, having schooled within this area for my primary education. By God's grace, I got selected to join Kagumo High School where I met a lot of interesting people and grew my physical, emotional, social and spiritual self. I graduated from The Kagumo High in the year 2023. I thank God for the amazing journey through my 17 years for life and I am eager to see what more He has planned for me in the future

                I very much enjoy playing video games, and have over the years become an expert in quite the select Minecraft, Roblox and other most popular video games. I have taken part in multiple events and really enjoy the communities of these games. Additionally, I greatly enjoy riding my bicycle for long hours! It takes my mind off things for a while, when things get hectic. Not to forget my love for chess, a game I ruly enjoy playing.,

                I am <strong>deeply passionate about Mathematics</strong>. There is just something so sweet about how numbers co-operate to describe accurately a lot of things in life. Growing in Mathematics has become so fun and has greatly opened my mind, making harder concepts in other subjects &lbbrk;excpet social subjects&rbbrk; become much easier to understand. I, genuinely, love Mathematics.

                In life, I greatly value integrity. It is mandatory that for a person to succed in improving all sectors of their life, one must ensure they are have integrity among their list of values. A person with integrity is able to make small incremental changes daily. In the same way, Rome was not built in a day.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify bg-gray-400 rounded-[6px] bg-opacity-50 mt-1">
                I am glad to have been chosen in the DirectEd program, but why did I apply anyway? I have seen through their social media and through alumni of our school that this program is sensible and great for a young mind interested in learning coding and Computer Science &lbbrk;Hey, that's me!&rbbrk;. Therefore, I find it presenting to me a great opportunity to grow in this vast field with able guidance from the DirectEd team.

                When I picture a perfect life in the future, I picture me living in a futuristic technologicla Kenya that has greatly improved technology. I envision Kenya being the next Singapore, and I want to be a part of that change through computer sciene and <abbr title="Artifical Intelligence" class="decoration-solid">AI</abbr>.
